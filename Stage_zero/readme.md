## 🧬 1. Essay  
**File:** `essay.md`  
**Title:** *Single Cells, Big Data: How One Cell Can Tell a Thousand Stories*  

This essay explores the evolution of **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)** and its impact on modern biology.  
It explains how single-cell technologies reveal cellular diversity, enable precision medicine, and drive innovation in disease modeling and therapeutic discovery.  

### Key Points:
- Transition from bulk to single-cell sequencing.  
- Core principles of single-cell technology: microfluidics, barcoding, sequencing, and data analysis.  
- Applications in cancer research and precision medicine.  
- Future directions: AI integration, multi-omics, and spatial transcriptomics.

## 💻 2. Python Script  
**File:** `simple_code.py`  

A simple Python script that prints details of all **Team Glycine** members including their names, Slack usernames, countries, hobbies, affiliations, favorite genes, and DNA sequences.

### Features:
- Uses a **list of dictionaries** for data storage.  
- Iterates with a basic `for` loop and prints formatted details.  
- Beginner-friendly — no external libraries or complex logic.
